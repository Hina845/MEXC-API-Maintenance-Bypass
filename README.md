# MEXC-API-Maintenance-Bypass

I have a method for bypass the maintenance of MEXC futures API for placing and canceling orders. I will sell this method, both full code with JS or Python, or show how I can bypass it.
There is no against-rule here, because my method will call exacly the API MEXC is providing.

Let say the price is 99 USDT, sweet isn't it?

Proof that the method works: https://youtu.be/33q6QKJ144k
